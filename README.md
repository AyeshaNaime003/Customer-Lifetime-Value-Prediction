# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction
The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning model that predicts the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) of a company's customer base. Accurately predicting CLTV can help companies identify high-value customers, tailer marketing campaigns accordingly, and improve customer retention strategies.
